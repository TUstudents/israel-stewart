## Usage Example

```python
from israel_stewart.core.performance import profile_operation, detailed_performance_report

# Profile operations with hierarchical tracking
with profile_operation("spectral_timestep", {"grid_size": (64, 64, 32, 32)}):
    with profile_operation("stress_energy_tensor"):
        # Your computation here
        pass

    with profile_operation("divergence_T"):
        # More computation
        pass

# Generate comprehensive report
report = detailed_performance_report()
```
