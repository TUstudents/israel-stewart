# Performance Profiler Suite

This directory contains the enhanced performance profiling infrastructure for the Israel-Stewart spectral solver.

## Files

### Core Implementation
- **Enhanced profiler**: Implemented in `israel_stewart/core/performance.py`
  - `DetailedProfiler`: Hierarchical timing and memory tracking
  - `FFTProfiler`: Specialized FFT operation profiling
  - Context manager API for easy instrumentation

### Profiling Scripts
- **`test_profiler.py`**: Demonstration script showing profiler capabilities
- **`plan_profiling.md`**: Comprehensive 3-phase optimization strategy

### Reports Generated
- **`detailed_performance_report.json`**: Hierarchical timing and memory analysis
- **`fft_efficiency_report.json`**: FFT-specific performance metrics

## Usage Example

```python
from israel_stewart.core.performance import profile_operation, detailed_performance_report

# Profile operations with hierarchical tracking
with profile_operation("spectral_timestep", {"grid_size": (64, 64, 32, 32)}):
    with profile_operation("stress_energy_tensor"):
        # Your computation here
        pass

    with profile_operation("divergence_T"):
        # More computation
        pass

# Generate comprehensive report
report = detailed_performance_report()
```
