## `israel_stewart/solvers/finite_difference.py`

**Review Summary:**

The file has a good structure, but the solvers are still incomplete and not yet usable for production. The addition of the `WENOFiniteDifference` scheme is a good step, but it needs to be fully implemented.

**Progress:**

*   A new `WENOFiniteDifference` scheme has been added.

**Remaining Issues:**

*   **Major Incomplete Features**:
    *   The `ConservativeFiniteDifference` scheme still uses a placeholder for the numerical flux (`_compute_numerical_flux`).
        *   **Hint:** Implement a standard numerical flux scheme like Lax-Friedrichs, which is easy to implement and provides the necessary dissipation for stability.
    *   The `_compute_christoffel_contributions` method in `ConservativeFiniteDifference` is still a placeholder.
        *   **Hint:** This method needs to compute the `Γ^μ_{αλ} T^{αλ}` terms. You can use `np.einsum` to contract the Christoffel symbols with the tensor field.
    *   The `UpwindFiniteDifference.compute_divergence` method still incorrectly delegates to the conservative scheme.
        *   **Hint:** A proper upwind divergence requires a characteristic decomposition of the fluxes. This is a more advanced topic, but a good starting point is to look at the Roe or HLLC solvers for relativistic hydrodynamics.
    *   The `WENOFiniteDifference` scheme is incomplete. The `_compute_weno_derivative` and `_compute_smoothness_indicator` methods are placeholders.
        *   **Hint:** The WENO scheme requires a careful implementation of the smoothness indicators and the nonlinear weights. You can find the standard formulas in the literature on WENO schemes.
*   **Performance Issues**:
    *   `_compute_second_derivative` in `ConservativeFiniteDifference` still uses a loop.
        *   **Hint:** This can be vectorized by using array slicing and broadcasting.
    *   `_compute_upwind_derivative` in `UpwindFiniteDifference` still uses a loop.
        *   **Hint:** This can also be vectorized using array slicing and broadcasting.

**Status:** Needs Revision.
