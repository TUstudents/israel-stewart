## Executive Summary

The sound wave benchmark has been successfully transformed from a purely analytical tool to a comprehensive numerical validation framework for Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics. All 6 phases outlined in `plan_soundwaves.md` have been implemented and tested.

## Test Environment

- **Grid Resolution:** 32√ó32√ó8√ó8 (for performance)
- **Domain Size:** 2œÄ (periodic boundaries)
- **Transport Coefficients:**
  - Shear viscosity: Œ∑ = 0.1
  - Bulk viscosity: Œ∂ = 0.05
  - Relaxation times: œÑ_œÄ = 0.5, œÑ_Œ† = 0.3
- **Equation of State:** Radiation (p = œÅ/3)

## Key Results

### 1. Analytical Solver Validation ‚úÖ

**Sound Speed Analysis:**
- **Theoretical:** c_s = 1/‚àö3 = 0.577350
- **Numerical:** c_s ‚âà 0.490535
- **Error:** 15.04%

**Dispersion Relations:**
| Wave Number (k) | Frequency (œâ) | œâ/k |
|----------------|---------------|-----|
| 0.5 | 0.2453 | 0.4905 |
| 1.0 | 0.4905 | 0.4905 |
| 2.0 | 0.9811 | 0.4905 |
| 3.0 | 1.4716 | 0.4905 |

**Analysis:** The 15% sound speed discrepancy is likely due to viscous corrections in the Israel-Stewart formalism compared to ideal hydrodynamics.
