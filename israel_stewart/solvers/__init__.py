"""
Numerical solvers for Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics equations.

This module provides a comprehensive suite of numerical methods for solving
relativistic hydrodynamics with second-order viscous corrections, including:

- **Finite Difference Methods**: Conservative, upwind, and WENO schemes for spatial discretization
- **Implicit Time Integration**: Backward Euler, IMEX Runge-Kutta, and exponential integrators
- **Operator Splitting**: Strang, Lie-Trotter, adaptive, and physics-based splitting methods
- **Spectral Methods**: FFT-based high-accuracy solvers for periodic problems

## Quick Start Examples

### Basic Solver Creation
```python
from israel_stewart.solvers import create_solver
from israel_stewart.core import SpacetimeGrid, ISFieldConfiguration, TransportCoefficients

# Setup problem
grid = SpacetimeGrid(...)
fields = ISFieldConfiguration(grid)
coeffs = TransportCoefficients(...)

# Create different solver types
fd_solver = create_solver("finite_difference", "conservative", grid, coeffs)
implicit_solver = create_solver("implicit", "backward_euler", grid, coeffs)
spectral_solver = create_solver("spectral", grid, fields, coeffs)
splitting_solver = create_solver("splitting", "strang", grid, coeffs)
```

### Specialized Factory Functions
```python
from israel_stewart.solvers import (
    create_finite_difference_solver,
    create_implicit_solver,
    create_splitting_solver,
)

# High-order finite difference
weno_solver = create_finite_difference_solver("weno", grid, metric, order=5)

# Adaptive implicit integration
adaptive_implicit = create_implicit_solver("imex_rk", grid, metric, coeffs, order=3)

# Physics-aware splitting
physics_split = create_splitting_solver("physics", grid, metric, coeffs)
```

## Performance Guidelines

- **Spectral methods**: Best for smooth, periodic problems (exponential convergence)
- **WENO finite difference**: Excellent for shock-capturing and discontinuities
- **Implicit solvers**: Essential for stiff relaxation equations (large Ï„/dt ratios)
- **Operator splitting**: Optimal for multi-scale physics with disparate timescales

## Solver Type Reference

### Finite Difference Schemes
- `ConservativeFiniteDifference`: Mass-conserving, stable for long-time evolution
- `UpwindFiniteDifference`: Characteristic-based, prevents numerical diffusion
- `WENOFiniteDifference`: High-order shock-capturing with adaptive stencils

### Implicit Time Integrators
- `BackwardEulerSolver`: Robust first-order, excellent stability properties
- `IMEXRungeKuttaSolver`: Higher-order with explicit hyperbolic/implicit relaxation
- `ExponentialIntegrator`: Specialized for linear relaxation operators

### Operator Splitting Methods
- `StrangSplitting`: Second-order symmetric splitting, good accuracy/cost balance
- `LieTrotterSplitting`: First-order, simple and robust for exploratory work
- `AdaptiveSplitting`: Automatic timestep control with error estimation
- `PhysicsBasedSplitting`: Multi-scale aware, optimized for IS equations

### Spectral Methods
- `SpectralISolver`: Core FFT-based spatial differentiation and operators
- `SpectralISHydrodynamics`: Complete spectral hydro solver with conservation laws
